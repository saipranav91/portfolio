This is my portfolio website, designed with a smooth background transition for an engaging user experience. To prevent random reloads and white flashes, I optimized performance by using in-memory caching instead of local or session storage. Additionally, I implemented image preloading before the initial run, ensuring seamless transitions without delays. These optimizations create a fluid, visually appealing, and uninterrupted browsing experience.
